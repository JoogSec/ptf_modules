# The Penetration Testers Framework Module
Here you can find custom Modules for the Penetration Tester Framework https://github.com/trustedsec/ptf.

This Framework helps you to organize your Penetest Tool. It's a real nice tool and easy to use. Any time I found a new tool which I can use for my panties project I make a module which can be downloaded here. Same as the framework warns I want to warn as well here:

All tools are downloaded directly from the developers websites as-is.  PTF doesn't perform any type of source code analysis or verification on the tools. You should run these after performing your own analysis of the tools and ensure you trust the parties. PTF only adds tools that are well-known typically in the security industry but that does not negate the risk. This is no different than any other tool distribution platform, operating system, or anything you would download from the Internet.

## How to use
After you downloaded the files from https://github.com/trustedsec/ptf you will find a folder named "modules/custom_lists" there you can add a new folder and copy the files into.
